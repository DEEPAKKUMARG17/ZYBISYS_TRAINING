                <h2>Cloud computing</h2>
                <p>Changes in technology and legacy IT infrastructure are becoming more disruptive, making it more expensive to maintain and support 
                    digital transformation.

                <h2>DATA CENTER</h2>
                <P>Technology revolutions is completely disruptive on the traditional datacenter operations and require nimbleness on creating hybrid platform to interconnect present datacenter operations with cloud based solutions to improve quality of service. Hypersonic in technology, datacenter operation needs resilience, agile and consistency on business deliverables to ensure smooth service to end customers. In general, datacenter service providers can support customers in deploying mission-critical hardware on their premises, but they do not support technological transitions to hybrid platforms, and it is difficult for customers to try new technologies, which can make business risky, and require Focus more on developing skills for team members and the effort required to achieve datacenter hybrid transformation.</P>
