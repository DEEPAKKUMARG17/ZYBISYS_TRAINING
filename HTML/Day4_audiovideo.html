            <p>Indraganesan College of Engineering was founded by <mark>Vidya Seva Ratnam”, “Guru Seva Mani” Auditor Sri.
                    K. Santhanam in the year 1998</mark>. It was so named in respectful memory of his Guru Principal
                Saranathan, the greatest ever Principal of National College. It is a self financing college approved by
                AICTE and affiliated to Anna University, Chennai.

                The college was temporarily (approx. 2 years) located in the Seshasayee Institute of Technology, thanks
                to the gracious permission from the Honorary Secretary and Correspondent of that Institution, Er. G.
                Sundaram and shifted to its current sprawling 40 acre campus on the Chennai – Madurai Expressway at
                Panjappur on 3rd January 2000 and was formally inaugurated on 19th October 2000, by “Peraasiriyar K
                Anbazhagan, the then Minister of Education, Government of Tamil Nadu.

                The college has a current annual intake of 660 students for the 7 branches offered at the undergraduate
                level and 132 students for the 5 courses offered at the post-graduate level.

                With a built up area of 200000 sq ft, 8 seminar halls and a state of the art library with more than
                55688 books and 225 periodicals and journals (both national and international), the college offers the
                ideal environment for the students to absorb and assimilate the top class technical education and
                professional training offered.

                The college has a well equipped Computer Centre and has installed internet with 76 Mbps connectivity.
                The entire college is networked with unique log-in IDs and passwords for each student. The Computer
                Centre takes great pride in the fact that they have installed and run a dedicated “cloud centre”.</p>

                    <h4>Cloud Computing</h4>
                    <p style="font-weight: 300;">The term cloud refers to a network or the internet. It is a technology
                        that uses remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and access data online rather than
                        local drives.
                        The data can be anything such as files, images, documents, audio, video, and more.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4> Devops</h4>

                    <p>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an
                        organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and
                        improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development
                        and infrastructure management processes.
                        This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in
                        the market.</p>

                <li>
                    <h4>machine learning</h4>

                    <p>A Machine Learning system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever
                        it receives new data, predicts the output for it. The accuracy of predicted output depends upon
                        the amount of data, as the huge amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the
                        output more accurately.

                        Suppose we have a complex problem, where we need to perform some predictions, so instead of
                        writing a code for it, we just need to feed the data to generic algorithms, and with the help of
                        these algorithms, machine builds the logic as per the data and predict the output. Machine
                        learning has changed our way of thinking about the problem.
